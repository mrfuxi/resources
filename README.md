## Design

* [Richard Feynman - Problem Solving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRuSQJlHV6s) - Some designs ideas do not scale. To move the different scale new designs are needed.

## Event sourcing

* [Greg Young - CQRS and Event Sourcing - Code on the Beach 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs) - Immutable events as a single source of truth, base for other "views" (SQL DB, full text index, ...) and time machine.
